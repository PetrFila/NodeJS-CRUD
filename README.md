* There needs to be prepared a few things before we start generating the actual application


# Installing KNEX JS

* KNEX is a middleware for Postgres and Node - something like Mongoose for Mongo DB and Node JS
* this guide assumes that Postres database is already installed and running

- run following outside of the app folder `yarn add knex`




# Generate Node JS app with Express and add Postgres

- create a folder
- inside of the folder run yarn (or npm) init and answer all the questions
- run yarn add express-generator - this will download the Express generator
- run yarn express - this will install complete app skeleton using the above mentioned generator
- in the root directory of the application run touch .gitignore - This will create that a file in which we can store other files's names to be ignored when pushing to git/github
